<font size=3>I am a **Professor in Astronomy and the Public Understanding of Science** in the [School of Mathematical and Physical Sciences (MPS)]() at the [University of Sussex](). I currently serve as **Head of Astronomy** (Director of the Astronomy Centre), and the **Director of Outreach and Public Egagement (DOPE)**.</font>

In my free time I am also the founder and chair of [Curiosity Sussex](https://curiositysussex.org.uk) a local science education charity in Sussex. I am also a trustee of [Science Projects](https://science-projects.org) a non-profit organisation bringing science to the public through interactive exhibits.

# Research

My research predominantly concerns understanding the process of galaxy formation and evolution especially in the early Universe. I use both observations (e.g. from Hubble, Spitzer, VLT, ALMA, and in the future Webb) and galaxy formation simulations.

You can see a list of publications (via ADS) [here](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/public-libraries/_a0G9KxeTUCeQl9UVDKCXw).

### Observations

I previously worked extensively with Hubble observations, particularly immediately after Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) was installed as part of the final servicing mission to Hubble in 2009. Observationally, I am currently focussed on the Webb Telescope which should launch by the end of 2021. See [this article](https://theconversation.com/how-hubbles-successor-will-give-us-a-glimpse-into-the-very-first-galaxies-45970) on the Conversation about how JWST will transform our view of the distant Universe.

I am a member of various observational teams, including the [Cosmic Evolution Early Release Science (CEERS)](), [COSMOS-Web](), [PRIMER](), and [NGDEEP](), all of which have secured time on JWST. I am also a member of the Hubbl [COS Legacy Archive Spectroscopic SurveY (CLASSY)](https://www.danielleaberg.com/classy), the [Euclid Consortium](), and the [Galaxy and Mass Assembly (GAMA) survey]().

### Simulations

I also work extensively with galaxy formation simulations, particularly hydrodynamical simulations which follow the co-evolution of dark matter, gas, stars, and black holes.

I was previously extensively involved in the [Massive Black]() and [Bluetides](http://bluetides-project.org") projects (PI Tiziana Di Matteo). I currently co-lead the [First Light and Reionisation Epoch Simualtions (FLARES) project](https://flaresimulations.github.io), a suite of simulations based on EAGLE but applying an innovative strategy allowing us to simulate a much larger effective volume of the Universe.

## Research Culture

### ACES

I am currently planning the STFC funded [Advanced Cosmology and Extragalactic astronomy Summer school (ACES)](www.stephenmwilkins.co.uk/aces). 

### SAZERAC

During the COVID-19 pandemic I established the [SAZERAC: the Summer All Zoom Epoch of Reionisation Astronomy Conference](http://sazerac-conference.org) alongside Steve Finkelstein. SAZERAC was established to provide the opportunity for early career researchers to promote their work. The first SAZERAC meeting attracted almost 400 participants with a series of spin-offs (SIPS) and a second summer meeting in 2021.
